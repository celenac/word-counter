This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

See app here: https://celenac.github.io/word-counter/

This tool counts the number of characters, words, and sentences in the pasted text. 
This tool also displays the number of times each word appears, sorted from high to low frequency.
Add words to "Hidden Words" to disable the word counter from tracking these words. Common words like "the" and "a" are added to the list of "Hidden Words" by default.
